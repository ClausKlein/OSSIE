The node booter installation process is the standard:

./configure
make
su -c "make install"

./configure --help returns the available configure options. The --with-omniorb
is useful if configure can not find omniOrb on your system.

Run the node booter with:

nodeBooter -D -d Foo.dcd.xml

This starts a Domain Manager and a Device Manager described by Foo.dcd.xml.

Be sure to configure omniNames properly. For more information see:
