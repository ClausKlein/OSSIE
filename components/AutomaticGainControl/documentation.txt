/*! \mainpage Automatic Gain Control

\section description Basic description
Automatic gain control (AGC) circuitry has long been used in radio
communications to help receivers adapt to varying signal levels.  Strong
signals are attenuated to prevent saturation while weak signals are amplified
to... This limits the dynamic range of the signal and is necessary in hardware
where fixed-point math is limited by dynamic range.

AGCs can also be used for audio signals such as to keep the output sound level
at a manageable and comfortable listening range.

\section properties Properties
The automatic gain control component allows a great deal of flexibility in its
operation, allowing it to be used in a variety of applications with only a few
modifications to its parameters.

\subsection prop_elo Low energy threshold (DCE:aaf97fa0-d184-4d88-9954-3a1334c73d6d)
The low energy threshold, \f$e_{lo}\f$, is that which triggers an increase in
gain in the AGC.  It must be less than or equal to the 
\ref prop_ehi "high energy threshold"

\subsection prop_ehi High energy threshold (DCE:346e17c9-6678-483a-bffb-1909c64bddc0)
When the incoming signal exceeds the high energy threshold, \f$e_{hi}\f$,
the AGC reduces its gain.  This value must be greater than or equal to the
\ref prop_elo "low energy threshold"

\subsection prop_ka Time constant (attack) (DCE:4608b943-4fe2-49df-91fb-afa287b609d4)
The attack time constant, \f$k_a\f$, governs the response time for which the
AGC reduces its gain for high energy signals.

\subsection prop_kr Time constant (release) (DCE:491ec3de-ed45-48af-a6fc-ca2d6465e136)
The release time constant, \f$k_r\f$, governs the response time for which the
AGC increases its gain for low energy signals.

\subsection prop_gmin Minimum allowable gain (DCE:312f63fe-709a-4217-933b-c584c8d6a9bb)
The minimum gain property, \f$g_{min}\f$, prevents the AGC from reducing its
gain to an unmanageable level.

\subsection prop_gmax Maximum allowable gain (DCE:8357ee0d-2417-46d9-8475-2e5778d797e4)
The maximum gain property, \f$g_{max}\f$, prevents the AGC from increasing its
gain to an unmanageable level.

\section interfaces Interfaces
The automatic gain control component contains two standard port interfaces,
described here.

\subsection port_data_in Port: "data_in"
The input signal (complexShort).

\subsection port_data_out Port: "data_out"
The output signals (complexShort).

\section dependencies Software build dependencies
The AGC component relies on the AutomaticGainControl class in
<a href="http://ossie-dev.mprg.org:8080/repos/ossie/browser/SigProc/trunk/SigProc">
SigProc</a>, the OSSIE signal processing library.  It also relies on the standard
iterfaces complexShort uses and provides ports descriptions.

\section algorithm Detailed Description of Algorithm
Basically this goes as follows:
  - signal level too large, decrease gain
  - signal level too small, increase gain

The attack and rise times are dependent upon both the time constants and the
sampling rates.

\section status Status and history
The AGC component is currently in development mode.
