OSSIE JPEG_VideoViewer component
================================

Installation notes:

1. This component requires the SDL library.
In Fedora, this can be installed by typing the following command as root:  # yum install SDL-devel

2. The associated WebCamCapture component also requires that you have a driver for your webcam.  gspca supports many webcams and is available from the livna repository.

A list of webcams supported by gspca is available at http://mxhaard.free.fr/spca5xx.html .  You can check the vendor id and product id of your webcam by plugging it in and typing:
# /sbin/lsusb

To install gspca, first enable the livna repository for your operating system, then as root, type the following commands:

# yum install gspca
# modprobe gspca  [if yum installs a new kernel, you will need to reboot the system before this step]
